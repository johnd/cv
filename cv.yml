      * Role is split between providing support (approximately 70%) and acting as sysadmin (30%) 
      * Support role primarily involves tracking issues in an extremely complex Perl-based application, taking total ownership of all issues and where necessary liaising with external companies to provide a resolution to the issue. 
      
      * Typical troubleshooting issues include: 
        - Subtle bugs/misapplications of business logic in perl scripts. 
        - Windows-based issues such as IIS and Outlook/Exchange configuration. 
        - System-based problems such as low disc space or connectivity problems. 
        - Often subtle issues with integration with third-party database applications and clients' existing systems. 
      
      * Junior sysadmin role involves providing internal support for approximately 20 staff, building and deploying CentOS-based servers and providing on-going maintenance and development for the internal network. 
      * Specific areas of this role include: 
        - Evaluating and refactoring existing server build processes, including the deployment of internal YUM repositories and extensive customisation of network boot scripts to streamline the deployment process.

      * Role required development of skills in Perl, Windows system administration, and improvement of existing skills with Linux system administration and MySQL. It has involved a considerable amount of work with VMware-based virtualisation software utilising almost their entire product range for various projects.
